## About Quick Audit
A professional asset management application for an electronic recycling company. It was designed to reduce the time spent auditing by standardizing and regulating the entire auditing process. We set and completed deadlines, so when the application was released, it was competitive in the market. We maintained a strong working relationship with the testing company to ensure quality at every turn. I was responsible for technical design and programming.
